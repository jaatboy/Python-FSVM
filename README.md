Python implementation of Fuzzy Support vector Machines.
Uses of Fuzzy Vector Machine are:
1. Removing Outliers
2. Can be applied on the data where recent data is more priortized
3. One class is more important than other

As an example i implimented Fuzzy SVM taking one class as more important
Precision was increased from 97% to 100%
Recall was increased from 97% to 100%
